* **Backups the old fashioned way**: Your journal data is stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Journal/journal.db`. You can export this to your Downloads folder in Settings to save to an external hard drive or import old journal entries to view in your Journal.
* **Ctrl + b**: Blur your screen when it's not in use. Also blurs automatically after a minute of non-use. Click to dismiss or hit Crtl+b again.
* **Dark mode**: Toggleable in Settings between System, Light, and Dark.
* **Encryption at rest**: AES-256 encryption on your local journal entries database.
