# Journal

A lightweight macOS-based journal with privacy as the first principle. There's no cloud syncing. No sharing. No other users. Just a nice composition experience on your mac.

### Features
* **Backups the old fashioned way**: Your journal data is stored in `~/Library/Application Support/journal.db`. You can export this to your Downloads folder in Settings to save to an external hard drive or import old journal entries to view in your Journal.
* **Ctrl + b**: Blur your screen when it's not in use. Also blurs automatically after a minute of non-use. Click to dismiss or hit Crtl+b again.
* **Dark mode**: Toggleable in Settings between System, Light, and Dark.
